**Part 1 - Question 3**:
Line 9 prints "values added: 20"

**Part 1 - Question 4**:
Line 13 returns an error "ReferenceError: result is not defined." This is because the let keyword makes the variable have block scope, so it can only be accessed in the block it was defined in and so result was not defined.

**Part 1 - Question 5**:
The code returns an error "TypeError: Assignment to constant variable." This is because the const keyword makes it so a variable with const prevents the variable from being reassigned which happens on line 7 so nothing is printed by line 9

**Part 1 - Question 6**:
The code returns an error "TypeError: Assignment to constant variable." This is because the const keyword makes it so a variable with const prevents the variable from being reassigned which happens on line 7 so nothing is printed by line 13.
